# The Happy Video Player
This was my final project for CS50x. It's a bare-bones single page application built with React.js. It fetches 10 funny videos from YouTube, based on a list positive words (have a look to `App.js:34`).

### Try it out
- Install yarn
- Run `yarn install`
- Run `yarn build` (for production) or `yarn dev` (for development)
- Go to `http://localhost:1234` (parcel.js default port)
